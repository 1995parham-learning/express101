# Express101

## Introduction

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is HTTP framework for NodeJS and I think to practice using it by writing an application to find and replace a given string
by another string.
At the time of writing this sample, Express v5 is still under development, so we install it as follows:

```bash
npm install express@next
```
